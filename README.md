# Epileptic Seizures Classification Using Deep Learning Models

This repository hosts a comprehensive framework for developing, training, and evaluating deep learning models for the classification of epileptic seizures. It provides streamlined scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and performance testing, ensuring a seamless end-to-end workflow.

---

## Overview

This project consists of three primary components:

1. **PreProcess.py**: A script for data cleaning and preprocessing.
2. **train.py**: A module for training deep learning models with configurable parameters.
3. **test.py**: A testing framework to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

---

## Components

### PreProcess.py
- **Purpose**: Cleans and prepares raw data for model training.
- **Features**:
  - Handles missing values.
  - Standardizes and normalizes data.
  - Performs feature engineering and transformations.
- **Usage**:


### train.py
- **Purpose**: Trains deep learning models using the processed dataset.
- **Features**:
  - Hyperparameter customization.
  - Automatic model checkpointing.
  - Detailed training metric logging.


### test.py
- **Purpose**: Evaluates the trained model on a test dataset and generates performance metrics.
- **Features**:
  - Supports multiple evaluation metrics.
  - Handles previously unseen test datasets.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher.
- **Dependencies**:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow or PyTorch (for deep learning models)
  - Matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)

Install the required dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arpan-000/EpilepticSeizureClassificationUsing-DL
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. **Prepare the dataset**:
   Use `PreProcess.py` to preprocess your raw data.

3. **Train the model**:
   Train your deep learning model using `train.py`.

4. **Evaluate the model**:
   Test the trained model's performance using `test.py`.
